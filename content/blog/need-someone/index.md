According to ‘Osho’(Acharya Rajneesh) a partner is someone with whom you can share your every thoughts and feelings, it’s hard to find someone who can keep your secrets with them “BIGGEST TASK” because our generation always want to share a gossip or hot news and they never think how much that gossip can hurt someone. Many quotes can motivate you to get a partner like:

>“It’s not about having time; it’s about making time by sharing thoughts”

And so, we have counter thoughts:

>“you alone are enough; you don’t need anyone to share”
> ~ Maya Angelou 

Both thoughts are completely different some might get motivate by first one and do accordingly and some might get motivate by second and act. Just like parallel universe (fictional concept) and actual universe concept these thoughts are just a mirror image. On a survey, 98% people have someone to whom they can share each and every thing. People term the rest of the 2% people as mental disorder patient and the reason is that kind of people love to be alone and not surrounded by someone, those people love to talk to themselves rather than talking to fake people.

#### REAL STORY

A guy who loves to be alone and hangout alone for no reason. He never spoke to anyone. He always tries to be in his room. People used to call him mental, “pagal”, they judge him just because he sits alone and talk to himself. His life changed when he met a girl and fell in love with her and started sharing his thoughts, his ideas of living, she loved those thoughts. When both started coming out in public. Some people called that girl mad for dating him. People still continued to judge them. No one thought once that the guy was recovering, no one questioned themselves that the guy was really facing problems or he was waiting for the right person.

They showed and proved 2 thoughts, “don’t think what other will think”; “wait for the one who’ll change your life and till then don’t let anyone be part of your life”. 

That’s true without letting in anyone in your life you can’t get that perfect one person who deserve you. But at least you can try to stop that person up to a limit, so if that guy ever went from your life won’t hurt you much. 

#### CONCLUSION

You need someone or not that’s on you, just keep some points as filter:

•	Don’t make anyone always unless he/she makes you always, as you never know you made always someone who already has an always in his or her life. Those people won’t think about you before leaving your life.
 
•	Keep some filters or hurdles before allowing anyone to become part of your life.
 
•	Before making anyone always, ask yourself that he/she deserve you or you deserve him/her.

•	Before talking to anyone, talk to yourself and explore yourself, maybe you don’t need anyone in your life. 

If you already have an “always” in your life and still someone made you “always” in their life, make sure you don’t break their heart, because millions of nerves are required for a brain to function properly, and only shock can destroy it within few minutes.
