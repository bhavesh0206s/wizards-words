> There is one green and blue planet named Earth somewhere on Orion Arm of Milky Way. It revolves around one star named Sun. And after many attempts, aliens have successfully reached this planet. They had left one alien spy fakely named Lav Khadela on a piece of land named India and went back to their planet. It has been 18 Earth Year's now since they had left him on this unknown planet. After surviving this many years between these weird humans now he is supposed to write a report on human behavior and why do they behave like this. This is how his report reads:

**To-** Not an Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), NoChill Planet
**Reported by-** Sabe a.k.a Lav Khadela<br>
**Subject-** Report on living creatures present on Earth

**Short Story:** People over here are messing up

**Long Story:** People over here are not born stupid. But due to a few reasons, most of them are stupid at the end of their life. Those reasons are explained in the further report.

The major part of converting normal children to idiot humans is unconsciously taken care of by their parents themselves. These humans become parent due to some reasons and they are as following:

1.  They were spending some so called quality time and that resulted in to baby
2.  They have babies because they have recently been feeling a sense of incompleteness in relationship and they hope it will make their lives purposeful again.
3.  They have babies because everyone of their age around them are having babies.
4.  They have babies because it appears to be a powerfull strategy to save their marriage
5.  They have babies so the baby can grow up to fulfill the dreams of either of the parents which remained unfulfilled due to some reasons.

As these reasons show that these people who become a parent are not mentally prepared or fit to be parent, this results into the wrong upbringing of the child and this child is gonna be hurting a lot of people in his/her life. Follow nonsense leaders. And parents are directly responsible for this.

So from my observation some parents are completely irresponsible, and therefore they send their child to school to learn something which can help them to live their life happily. But the education system over here is good for nothing. There is no option to select the type of schooling all of them to offer Prussian schooling system with some minor changes (this education system was developed to win a war) best alternative to this would Sudbury schools, but it is, unfortunately, hard to find one in India.<br>
All these traditional schools teach a child is What to think instead of how to think and How to work for money instead of how to let money do work for you. Everyone in this education system wants to become an engineer or doctor. No one wants to choose art or sport as a profession over here. Everyone tends to like some artist or sportsmen and their work but no one wants to become one or aren't allowed or encouraged to be one.

In school, they make friends and go out with those friends to watch movies. What kind of movies? BOLLYWOOD movies. What do they learn from it? Love? Nope, what they learn is bullshit. Because Bollywood movies show that love is equal to lovemaking and that is like porn and sex are equal. No, they aren't. Love has nothing to do with lovemaking, Love is all about caring. That is why a mother always takes care of her child and not perform physical intimacy.

##Summary:
Humans are messing up this planet named Earth. They have no future. They call themself homo-sapiens but the truth is that they are no better than apes.

####PS: I am telling you, Mr. Zoe, these humans are weird creators they don't know what they are doing and how it is affecting other peoples in their surroundings. This planet isn't among the planet with whom we should have a relationship like friendship. Better we stay away from them.<br>
And our contract was that I am supposed to live here for 15 Earth Year's only, three extra years have passed When should I expect to see you with that ship in the sky?
