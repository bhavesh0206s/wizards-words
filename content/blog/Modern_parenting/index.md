Indian Old parenting style is at the highest peak in worst way of handling their children.

The main reason is because parents keep comparing their children with others in society. They try to mould their children according to rules of society, according to what they have learned in past. And we know that society rules doesn’t have importance for private space for children, nor different beliefs and choices are allowed and have bad definition of respect.

Respect is a concept that only works one way, because parents will never respect a child's choices and decisions.

They’re so insecure about themselves that they cannot stand their kid being too different, or else – a question is raised on everything they did based on their belief system so far in their life, and they cannot be in that uncomfortable position of accepting that they might have been wrong at some point.

Any form of disagreement with parents is seen as disrespect.

Children need their own space they can't make their story based on your imagination. People like to read different stories, but if you want to make children based on your beliefs and rules then there would be no different stories.

We understand that parents care for their child and that's why they keep on guiding in every point of life, parents should stop doing these. How will they make their own path, how will they write their own stories, how will children understand what’s right what’s wrong without experimenting with their life.

If parents don’t understand their kid, then their children will reach out to world where someone else can understand them and this way children’s get detached with their parents. And they will stop sharing feelings , things and everything which they used to share when they were a small kids.

Parents keep complaining that children won't understand why they are being scolded etc... but the thing is they never understood their child and then how can they expect their child to understand them.

They can’t play with parents rules there game is different and so are their rules.

If parents think their child owe them something in return for their love and care, their sacrifices and financial investments then they are wrong because Love, respect and care are mutual emotions that should be given unconditionally without expecting anything in return and talking about sacrifices, children are also going to do that for their child and these is how things work.

Parents should not expect things , those things will happen at right time and in right manner, its just the matter of how much they believe on their child.

Parents just need to believe in their child, they will shower parents with unconditional love and support, without parents having to ask for it.

Child want parents to let them grow in their way, accept their beliefs, opinions and principles and they may be wrong in some of their decisions but that's how they will learn what's right and what's wrong. But if parents won't let them take their decisions their way, their child would never be able to take decisions in their hard times of life.

In last I only want to say is that every child is different, so you have to treat them differently. Accept them how they are and the most important point believe in them they will do it, they will fight life, they will give you so much of love, at the end they are your child and they will succeed in life as you as a parent did.

**Until parent start believing their children nothing is going to change.**
