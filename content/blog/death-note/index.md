This blog is dedicated to one of my favorite anime **DEATH NOTE**. In this blog, I would be talking about some life lessons I learned by watching this anime.

**SPOILER ALERT:** If you haven’t watched death note yet but are planning to watch. Then I would suggest you don’t proceed with this blog.
# Lesson-0: Never pick up a death note. NEVER
# Lesson-1: The world you live in is an unfair world
The world we live in has got many variables, out of which luck holds the most weight.
In this anime, Light Yagami got death note just because he was lucky, while in our world someone born in a well-doing family just by luck, like as sperm you don’t know if you want to win that race or not, you just give your best and award might be pleasant or possibly not. If you were introduced to upcoming circumstances like who your family will and what environment they live in then no sperm cell will win a race where they are awarded poverty and hunger.
The good guys do not always win, sometimes the world is just wrong.
Their is a nice youtube video named "Life of Privilege Explained in a $100 Race" which can explain this more clearly.
# Lesson-2: People are the root of all evil
I believe all the sayings like "Money is the root of all evil", are crap. In reality, people are the root of all evil.
Items, material, money… that has nothing to do with anything happing in the world. They’re not the problem, the problem is their user, that is the person who uses it.
Light Yagami was a bored kid with no direction or purpose in his life. So when he ends up with the Death Note by accident, the power goes to his head. And we immediately got the purpose of his life, killing the criminals. And then ended up killing innocent peoples.
Not get me wrong here, I am not telling that all people are like that but I am trying to convey that Power Corrupts.
Power should not be given into someone’s hands who haven’t carefully worked on their mindset and self-esteem. Otherwise, power will destroy everyone and everything around them and destroy that person itself in the end.

# Lesson-3: Be yourself
This is something very basic and important I learned from Law, Many people spend their whole life pleasing and impressing other peoples around them.
But in reality, You don't’ need to care what others say unless you are not harmful to others. Sit however you want to, wear what you wanna wear, have your hair however you like them.

# Lesson-4: Don’t trust anyone without data
Even your best friend will stab you in the back if they’re the wrong friend, to begin with. And that is exactly what Light did to Law. I was speechless when Law died. Light pretended to be his friend who cares about it and when the time came he shows his real face and did exactly what he does, kill the person who tries to stop him.
So, cautiously spend time with people, collect data do not rely on the first impression and analyze the data, and then start to develop any kind of relationship you want with them.
I this world you will go through a lot of betrays but you should be careful enough to minimize their number. Nowadays humans are having multiple faces and you never know which one is real so, have your emotional radius and don’t let anyone penetrate through it.

# Lesson-5: There’s no such thing as a perfect society
No matter how perfect a society gets, there’s always someone who opposes it. That’s not to say there’s no use making an effort, just that the idea of perfect isn’t shared by everyone.“Unless someone makes the first move, nothing will happen.” – Misa Amane


Light’s perfect society was different while Law had a different society which was perfect for him.
Justice itself is very subjective. It is no good or evil, there is only power. Truly, whoever has power decides what "good" and "evil".
