*It’s 9 only and I have to go to practice football,  
With permission of Mom and bag on shoulder,  
Goodbye, with shine in eyes and chocolate in hand,  
Didn’t know how to react, with presence of beauty on land,  
Was the first time for such I experience  
Took chocolate and went to the field with credence  
By each step, feelings raise for her.*   

*It’s 9 only and I’m waiting for her to be online,  
Ready to confess feelings with 2 or more line.  
A bit nervous, sweating, hands shaking,  
“Positive future”, mind was mistaking.  
She came in black clothing, stress increased,  
WOOOSHHHH!! I confessed.  
But I’m bold enough to handle rejection by her.*   

*It’s 9 only and I have a question paper in my palm,  
Less tension, watching her made my mind calm.  
Happy to love person with enthralling eyes,   
15 minutes still left and I’m done!  
“what do you think about me?” a question from right,  
Wasn’t ready for such question, but.   
I answered, had to answer sweet sounding tone of her.*   

*It’s 9 only and I’m entering movie hall with 2 tickets,  
With the same girl, 2-year senior to me,  
With a tub of popcorn and with few chip packets.  
My love increased with every second, as the time flee.  
Something is strange, she is guilty or something else?  
She confessed her feelings first,   
She disclosed her situation second,  
 And I’m bold enough to accept situation of her.*  

*It’s 9 only and I’m standing at college gate,  
With plethora of knowledge and uncontrolled happiness,  
With a lucrative job waiting on other side of gate.   
Something was more attractive, with a lot brightness.  
She on my right with her mother,  
I shifted my attention towards my career.  
Because I’m bold enough to supress my feelings for her.*
