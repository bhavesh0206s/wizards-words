This is 2020 or maybe any other year in future. You are the most intelligent person on the planet and you have somehow invented the time machine. You decided to travel back in time to change the future.

After travelling, suppose 1000 years back you realize how much does the past suck, there is no clean water, terrible smells in towns and villages, and no luxuries that you got today. No one understands what a cellphone and laptops are and even the people don't have an idea of a light bulb and also the jeans that you wore is going to get a lot of attention, so don't forget to change it.

While travelling back in time you have to remember you are going in the past to change the future for the advancement of the humanity, so don't forget to take some necessary stuff which will be useful in the journey. 

####Let's starting inventing.

The first thing is language, let's assume you can speak English but modern old English is different than the English way back.

You must have read or even looked at some of the Shakespeare works, how different and confusing the language was. Suppose you have brought a dictionary with you and you hire some guys from the past and told them to mass-produce it for you and somehow you are able to convince people to use modern English. Congratulations you invented modern English. You have pushed the humanity 100s of year already.

None of the invention matter if people aren't alive for long enough to learn and make discoveries that will push society forward. Health is super important and this is the time to bring your medical knowledge that you recently got by reading books. Germs and virus are things that you know have created the worse situation in the world and recently which is creating a problem in your modern world.
You have to teach people to wash their hands and bodies frequently. To fight antibodies you somehow is able to create the penicillin, it's super effective against infections because it stops other bacteria from reproducing making person healthy again. Boom! you have saved humanity from many diseases.

Probably by now you must have some cows, and milk they produced has quite germs and you definitely don't want to drink it directly, so have to heat it up to the boiling point and wait for a minute, you have just invented pasteurization and created clean milk for everyone to drink.

###Now let's talk about science


The equation **F=ma** will change the way people see the world before Issac Newton invent it, you can take the credit for it as no one knows about it. This equation is powerful enough to define gravity and take humans to the moon.

People aren't aware of the word electricity, they used water wheels or coals to generate energy. Now it's time to discover electricity, first, go to the place of lighting strike and look for a lodestone or look for magnetite on beaches, they are magnetic. Now get something to rotate and wrap that rotating object with coils of wire in the middle and you'll generate electricity. Congratulations you just discovery electricity and AC current at the same time. This discovery of yours will make mankind technologically advanced and allow mankind to spread at the fastest rate possible.

###Here are some more inventions that will be quite useful.

Now take the newly found electricity and run it through the tungsten, now you have a light bulb.

Create a magnet that can move on its own and you've just invented the compass, now people don't have to rely on North Star for the direction.

If you run powerful electricity back and forth through a wire strong enough, you've invented the radio transmitting radio waves, at a certain frequency will allow you to send signals to and from multiple antennas allowing for Lightspeed communication you can also take high-frequency radio waves send them out and see how long it takes for them to bounce back to you you have just invented radar.

Logic gates are used to create computations with enough logic gates connected in the proper way you'll have something with enough power to do complex computations we call these Computers. When multiple of these computers are connected together and Wow! you have created the mankind one of the best invention internet


You have made enough invention to help humanity to make their life easier but there are some invention you need to avoid. You have introduced the world with atoms the building block of everything. You created the equation **E=mc^2**, yes have can take credit for it, which will be used in harnessing the energy by fission or fusion of atoms, that can be used for generating electricity and have many other positive impacts but you have seen how this thing is going to be used in future, people are going to make nuclear bombs which will lead to destruction and death of thousands of humans and has almost resulted in the end of humanity.

One of the main reason you have been to the past is to revamp the future. You're aware that the increase in the GreenHouse effect due to human activity, is making our planet warmer which hasn't been matched in the millions years. It's the fault of future generation which had relied on fossil fuels and other non-renewable sources of energy. Toxic gases in the atmosphere are destroying the Ozone layer. So, your duty is to find clean renewable energy sources from the start and teach the people's about it.

###You will have to save the planet or else there won't the future worth waiting for.
