You might have seen in movies that manipulation tactics and getting people to do anything you want is possible or even easy. Is it possible to gain such ability? YES. But why do you need to manipulate someone? Because, someday someone in your life will not do what you are willing them to do, and you donât want to settle for disappointment.

_**Side note:** Manipulation is not evil. It is just another tool, the nature of it depends on the user._

Manipulation is like art, you cannot learn it just by reading this blog. This blog is just push for interested people, you need to read and practice a lot to master this art. There is no common technique that can be used to manipulate people. So, in this blog, we will mostly focus on flow of implementation.
**Step-1: Attention**
**Step-2: Trust**
**Step-3: Sending mixed signals**
**Step-3 Pain**

### Step-1: Attention
You cannot go to a random person and ask them for a favor or if they can do something for you. So, firstly you need to have their attention. For that, you need to have a few things with you. The human brain has mainly two parts, emotional and logical. In this step, we will penetrate through available vulnerabilities of the emotional part of the brain.
    1. Popular: you need to popular among people. It is not important but it gives you the upper hand if you are because it plants curiosity related to you into the brain of your victim.
    2. Smile: Smile represents happiness and people are attracted to the one emitting happiness as if they can catch it. And it also makes the fell like they are special and you like their company.

_People may forget what you did or said but they will remember the way you made them feel._

In this phase, you should not talk about anything related to your main motivation.

### Step-2: Trust
In this phase, you have two main motives.
    1. To gain trust, it can be achieved by sharing your personal experiences. It does not need to be a true story. This will convey the message that you trust them and are expecting the same thing from them.
    2. Read them, after gaining trust they will most probably share their stories with you can you need to connect those dots and figure out what kind of person you are dealing with.

### Step-3: Send mix signals:
Now after knowing what kind of person your victim is you need to know their goals and reverse engineer it towards the goal you want to accomplish. But, don't do this in an obvious manner, pass them mixed signals including genuine suggestions and what you want them to do, so that they can achieve their goals (and you can achieve yours).
_People love feeling like it was THEIR idea (not yours)._

And secondly, you need to make them curious related to your idea. Because, _You can lead people to water but sometimes you can't make them drink. So instead, make them THIRSTY._


### Step-4: Pain a.k.a End Game
Time to do your final move after all this efforts its time to end this. In this phase, you need your victim to experience pain. The pain of losing or something like that which calls for instant action. Like opportunity which is only available for some small period and they might lose this deal. This will knock down their logical brain, force them for impulsive decision and give you the power and control.

To summarise this I would like to give an example of the Indian Education System, It catches your attention by showing great rewards which you will achieve after your studies. They showcase their ex-students who are now succesfull and have nothing to so with their school. Then it makes you experience the pain of losing your dream job. So, your parents put you into a system accepting you will be having a bright future. But in the end, after sucking the all money from you, they leave you with a useless degree and unemployment. See, how you are the victim of this manipulation game?
